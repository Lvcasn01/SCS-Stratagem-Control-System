S.C.S - Stratagem Control System
A standalone desktop utility for Helldivers 2, designed to make using stratagems faster and more reliable. This tool is focused on improving accessibility for players with physical limitations and providing freedom of play for those who prefer a more tactical experience over input dexterity.

This application is built with Python and does not modify any game files.

Why This Project is Open Source
The core function of this application requires listening to keyboard/mouse inputs and simulating key presses. This behavior is similar to how some malicious software operates, which can cause antivirus programs to flag the application as a potential threat (a "false positive").

By making this project fully open source, my goal is to be 100% transparent. You can examine every line of code in this repository to verify for yourself that the application is safe and does exactly what is described. There is nothing hidden.
